This is my personal Portfolio website project. I upgraded it to next js so I can add new components, do SEO and have benefit of server side rendering.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
